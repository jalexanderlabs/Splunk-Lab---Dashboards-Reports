This write up continues my learning journey of the Splunk platform. In this lab, I will be learning about dashboards and reports. 

Objectives:
1)Learn why you need to organize data in Splunk
2)How to create dashboards to visualize information
3)Turning SOC use cases into alerts


The main reason that Splunk includes dashboards to help organize the overwhelming amount of data that gets forwarded and indexed into Splunk.
